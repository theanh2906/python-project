# Firebase Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The application was showing the error: "Your default credentials were not found. To set up Application Default Credentials, see https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc for more information."

This error occurred even though the service account key was correct and properly base64 encoded.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the Firebase initialization logic in `firebase-storage-management.py`. While Firebase Admin SDK was being initialized correctly with the service account credentials, the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) client was being created separately without passing the same credentials:

```python
# This was the problematic code:
self.storage_client = gcs.Client(project=self.PROJECT_ID)  # No credentials passed!
```

This caused the GCS client to fall back to looking for Application Default Credentials (ADC), which weren't set up.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified `init_firebase()` method
- Added a `gcs_credentials` variable to store credentials for the GCS client
- Created GCS credentials from the same source as Firebase Admin credentials
- Passed these credentials to the GCS client constructor

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### For Base64 Encoded Credentials (.b64 files):
```python
# Decode base64 encoded credentials
credentials_dict = self.decode_base64_credentials(self.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH)
cred = credentials.Certificate(credentials_dict)
# Create GCS credentials from the same dictionary
from google.oauth2 import service_account
gcs_credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(credentials_dict)
```

#### For JSON Credentials (.json files):
```python
# Load regular JSON credentials file
cred = credentials.Certificate(self.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH)
# Create GCS credentials from the same file
from google.oauth2 import service_account
gcs_credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(self.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH)
```

#### GCS Client Initialization:
```python
# Get storage client and bucket with proper credentials
if gcs_credentials:
    self.storage_client = gcs.Client(project=self.PROJECT_ID, credentials=gcs_credentials)
    print("[DEBUG] GCS client initialized with service account credentials")
else:
    self.storage_client = gcs.Client(project=self.PROJECT_ID)
    print("[DEBUG] GCS client initialized with default credentials")
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better debug logging to trace the authentication flow
- Added an additional error message about service account permissions
- Improved error messages to help with troubleshooting

## Files Modified
1. `firebase-storage-management.py` - Main application file with authentication fix
2. `test_firebase_auth.py` - New test script to verify authentication works

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Authentication Test
```bash
python test_firebase_auth.py
```

This test will verify:
- ✓ Base64 credentials file exists and is readable
- ✓ Base64 decoding works correctly
- ✓ All required Firebase modules are installed
- ✓ Firebase initialization works without falling back to default credentials
- ✓ GCS client can access the storage bucket

### Step 2: Run the Main Application
```bash
python firebase-storage-management.py
```

Look for these debug messages in the console:
- `[DEBUG] Using base64 decoded credentials`
- `[DEBUG] Firebase initialized with service account key`
- `[DEBUG] GCS client initialized with service account credentials`
- `[DEBUG] Firebase Storage initialized successfully`

## Expected Results

### Before the Fix:
- Error: "Your default credentials were not found"
- Application would fail to initialize Firebase Storage
- Debug logs would show fallback to default credentials

### After the Fix:
- No authentication errors
- Both Firebase Admin SDK and GCS client use the same service account credentials
- Application successfully initializes and can access Firebase Storage
- Debug logs show proper credential usage

## Additional Notes

### Required Dependencies
Make sure these packages are installed:
```bash
pip install firebase-admin google-cloud-storage google-auth
```

### Service Account Permissions
Ensure your service account has the following roles:
- Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent
- Storage Admin (or Storage Object Admin for basic operations)

### Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:
1. Check that `serviceAccountKey.b64` exists in the project directory
2. Verify the base64 content is valid (run the test script)
3. Ensure your Firebase project has Storage enabled
4. Check that the service account has proper permissions
5. Review the debug logs for specific error messages

## Security Considerations
- The base64 encoding provides basic obfuscation but is not encryption
- Keep your service account key files secure and never commit them to version control
- Consider using environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate service account keys as per security best practices
